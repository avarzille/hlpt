Before doing *anything*, I recommend you back things up.

Anyway, this isn't intended as a fully fledged library. It's mostly a POC
to show a new implementation for libpthread. I decided to name it HLPT, or
Hurdish Libpthread, because I'm terrible at naming things (I'm also behind
'gsync', which is the building block for this lib, so this should come as
no surprise).

The lib currently has no configure script. By default, it will install the
header files to /usr/local/include and the shared object to /usr/local/lib.
If you wish to change this, you'll have to modify the makefile.

Note that typing 'make' isn't enough. You need to make some modifications to
GNU Mach. In particular, you need the latest patches that implement the gsync
module. You'll also need to apply the patch located in 'ttr2.diff'. This is
necessary to correctly implement thread joining. So, you'll have to download
the kernel sources, apply the patch, install that kernel, and *then* will you
be able to compile the lib.

In order to facilitate things, there are 2 header files that implement the
routines that make use of the new kernel features. This is so that rebuilding
and installing a new glibc is not necessary.

Once you have the patched kernel, you can compile and install the lib. It's as
easy as typing 'make' and then 'make install'. You can also uninstall it with
(what else) 'make uninstall'. I plan on providing a test suite shortly.
